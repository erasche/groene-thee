# Groene Thee

An exploration of the possibilities of PostgREST and Angular JS to allow for
rapid development of a read-only alternative to Tripal. This is more
appropriate for sites who just wish to display data without necessarily using
Tripal pipelines for loading their data as they do that from Galaxy/Apollo.

This will not be everyone's use case, and is an **experiment**.
